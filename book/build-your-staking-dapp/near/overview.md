Staking on the NEAR blockchain involves locking up tokens to support the network's security and operations. In return, stakers earn rewards.

{% hint style="info" %}

The NEAR blockchain, known for its scalability, low transaction fees, and developer-friendly environment, employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which allows validators and delegators to participate in maintaining the network.

{% endhint %}

The **Chorus One SDK** simplifies this process, providing developers with the tools needed to build, sign, and broadcast staking transactions.

{% hint style="info" %}

### Compatibility Notice

The methods provided in this documentation are compatible with popular NEAR libraries such as `near-api-js`. This compatibility ensures that you can seamlessly integrate these methods into your existing NEAR projects.

{% endhint %}

This guide will walk you through the fundamentals of staking on NEAR using the Chorus One SDK.

## Setting Up the Staker

To get started with staking on the NEAR network using the Chorus One SDK, you will first need to initialize the SDK for NEAR.

- (For testing purposes, we will use the NEAR testnet).

First, create an instance of `NearStaker` with the necessary configuration:

```javascript
import { NearStaker } from '@chorus-one/near'

const staker = new NearStaker({
  networkId: 'testnet',
  rpcUrl: 'https://rpc.testnet.near.org'
})
```

**Configuration Parameters**:

- **networkId**: The network ID of the NEAR network (e.g., `mainnet`, `testnet`)
- **rpcUrl**: The URL of the NEAR network RPC endpoint
- **denomMultiplier**: (Optional) This parameter defines the scaling factor used to convert from the smallest unit of the networkâ€™s currency (`yoctoNear`) to its base unit (`NEAR`).

  For the NEAR mainnet, `1 NEAR` is equal to `1,000,000,000 yoctoNear`, hence the multiplier is `1,000,000,000`. This value is used to convert the amount of tokens in transactions.

- **gas**: (Optional) The maximum amount of gas to use for transactions. This value can be adjusted based on the complexity of the transactions.

---

## Initializing the Staker

After configuring the `NearStaker`, initialize it to prepare for staking operations.

This can be done via the following input:

```javascript
await staker.init()
```

The `init` method establishes a connection with the configured RPC endpoint and prepares the staker for operations such as building and broadcasting transactions.

---

## Building Transactions

Once the staker and signer are set up, you can start building transactions for staking operations.

The `NearStaker` class provides methods to build transactions for staking, unstaking, and withdrawing rewards.

- You can learn more about these methods in the [Methods](./methods.md) section.

**Example of building a staking transaction:**

```javascript
const { tx } = await staker.buildStakeTx({
  delegatorAddress: 'your.near',
  validatorAddress: 'chorusone.pool.f863973.m0',
  amount: '1' // 1 NEAR
})
```

---

## Getting the Validator Address provided by Chorus One

The `@chorus-one/near` module includes the `CHORUS_ONE_NEAR_VALIDATOR` constant, which contains the Chorus One validator address for building transactions.

```javascript
import { CHORUS_ONE_NEAR_VALIDATOR } from '@chorus-one/near'

const validatorAddress = CHORUS_ONE_NEAR_VALIDATOR
```

---

## Signing the Transaction

Once the transaction is built, you can sign that transaction using your own signing solution e.g.:

```js
const signedTx = await yourWallet.signTransaction(tx)
```

Additionally, you can use the Chorus One SDK to sign transactions using Fireblocks, mnemonic or other methods.

- For detailed information on setting up and configuring these options, please refer to the [What is a Signer?](../../signers-explained/what-is-a-signer.md) section.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Using Fireblocks for Signing" %}

By integrating Fireblocks, you can leverage its robust security features to sign transactions on the NEAR network. To set up Fireblocks, provide the necessary API key, secret key, and vault ID:

```javascript
import { NearStaker } from '@chorus-one/near'
import { FireblocksSigner } from '@chorus-one/signer-fireblocks'

const signer = new FireblocksSigner({
  apiSecretKey: 'your-api-secret-key',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  vaultName: 'your-vault-name',
  assetId: 'NEAR_TEST',
  addressDerivationFn: NearStaker.getAddressDerivationFn()
})

await signer.init()

const { signedTx } = await staker.sign({
  signer,
  signerAddress: 'your.near',
  tx
})
```

For more information please refer to the [Signing with Fireblocks](../../signers-explained/fireblocks.md)

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

---

## Broadcasting the Transaction

After signing the transaction, you will need to broadcast it to the network. You can do this using the `broadcast` method:

```javascript
const {
  transaction: { hash: txHash }
} = await staker.broadcast({ signedTx })
```

And now you can track the transaction status:

```javascript
const { status, receipt } = await staker.getTxStatus({
  address: 'your.near',
  txHash
})

console.log(status) // 'success'
```
